        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>How does the virus spread?</h3>
            COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What is Community Spread?</h3>
            Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions.

            <h3>Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for Covid-19?</h3>
            Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps toâ€¯protect yourself and others.
